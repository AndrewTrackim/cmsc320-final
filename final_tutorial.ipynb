        "Every two years, every member of the United States House of Representatives is up for election. After being elected, members of the House are given a set budget from the legislature itself to hire staff, buy office equipment, and defray other costs of legislating and addressing constituent concerns. While each office gets the same amount of money from Congress to spend on these purposes, congressional offices have discretion over how that allowance is actually spent, and we would like to see whether some spending patterns are associated with higher political success.
